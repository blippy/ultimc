Ultimc is a toy, experimental  implementation of the Forth programming 
language. It can be compiled to both hosted and native forms. "Hosted" 
means that it runs on an OS (Operating System). All popular platforms
are supported, including Windows and Linux.

The "native" form means that it runs "bare-metal" on ARM processors, 
i.e. without any underlying OS. 
There are customisations for the Raspberry Pi computers. The most
convenient way to perform experimental development work is via QEMU.
QEMU's emulation of Raspberry Pi is incomplete as of 30 Sep 2018, 
so you should only try to run the generic ARM version on it, not the Pi
version.
